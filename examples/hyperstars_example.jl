# --- 1. Package Imports and Environment Setup ---
# These are standard Julia packages required for various operations
using ArchGDAL # For geospatial data operations (though not directly used in this snippet's core logic, it's often part of a geospatial workflow)
using Rasters # Essential for working with raster data structures, aggregating, and spatial indexing
using Plots # For visualization, specifically creating a heatmap of the fused image
using Statistics # Provides `mean`, `std`, and other statistical functions
using JLD2 # For loading data stored in JLD2 format (Julia's binary data format)
using Distributed # Crucial for parallel processing using Julia's `pmap`
using MultivariateStats # For performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
using LinearAlgebra # Provides `Diagonal`, `I` (identity matrix), and other linear algebra utilities

# Add worker processes for parallel execution.
# This line starts 8 additional Julia processes that can run code concurrently.
# The number of processes typically matches the number of CPU cores available for optimal performance.
addprocs(8)

# The `@everywhere` macro executes the subsequent expression on all available worker processes.
# This ensures that the `HyperSTARS` module and its functions are loaded into memory on all workers,
# which is necessary for `pmap` to execute `HyperSTARS` functions in parallel.

# --- 2. Data Loading ---
# This section loads synthetic hyperspectral data from a JLD2 file.
# The data simulates measurements from different satellite sensors: EMIT, HLS, and PACE.
# It also includes a `target_array` which represents the desired high-resolution grid.

    emit_csize = f["emit_csize"] 
    pace_csize = f["pace_csize"] ## spatial resolution of pixels, negative means coordinate is descending

    # Load the spatial origin (top-left corner) of each sensor's image.

# The result `pace1km_array` will have half the spatial resolution of the original `pace_array`.

# --- 3. Fusion Setup ---
# This section prepares the data and model parameters required by the HyperSTARS fusion functions.

### Spatial size of each instrument array
# These define the number of rows and columns for each sensor's grid.

### Get spectral basis functions using EMIT (PCA)
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data.
# The resulting principal components (stored in `B`) will serve as the "latent spectral basis"
# for the fusion model, simplifying the spectral estimation.
emit_rt = reshape(permutedims(emit_array, (1,2,4,3)),(size(emit_array)[1]*size(emit_array)[2]*size(emit_array)[4],size(emit_array)[3]))'
# Reshape the EMIT data: (rows, cols, time, wavelengths) -> (rows*cols*time, wavelengths)
# Then transpose (`'`) to make wavelengths the rows and observations the columns, suitable for PCA.

emit_rt2 = emit_rt[:,.!vec(any(isnan, emit_rt; dims=1))]
# Filter out columns (observations) that contain `NaN` (Not a Number) values, as PCA cannot handle them.

mm = mean(emit_rt2, dims=2)[:] # Calculate the mean spectral signature (per wavelength)
sx = std(emit_rt2, dims=2)[:] # Calculate the standard deviation spectral signature (per wavelength)
Xt = (emit_rt2 .- mm) ./ sx # Normalize the data (mean-center and scale by std dev)

# Fit a PCA model to the normalized EMIT data.
# `pratio=0.995` means components are retained until 99.5% of the variance is explained.
pca = MultivariateStats.fit(PCA, Xt; pratio=0.995)
B = projection(pca) # `B` is the projection matrix (principal components or eigenvectors). This is our spectral basis.
vrs = principalvars(pca) # `vrs` are the variances explained by each principal component.
scs = predict(pca, Xt) # `scs` are the scores, i.e., the original data projected onto the principal components.

### Create geospatial structs for each instrument
# `InstrumentGeoData` stores static geospatial information (origin, cell size, dimensions)
# and also includes a `fidelity` flag:
# 0: highest spatial resolution (e.g., target resolution)
# 1: high resolution, but not the target resolution
# 2: coarse resolution
# The `rsr` (Relative Spectral Response) parameter is crucial for spectral conversion.

target_ndims = hls_ndims # The ultimate prediction grid size is set to the HLS dimensions (e.g., 30m).
